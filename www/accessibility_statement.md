# Accessibility statement 

*Created: 25 January 2025 Updated: 25 February 2025* 

This accessibility statement applies to the System Level Indicator Visual Tool. 

The statement is prepared by checking the tool against the accessibility statements from [UKCEH](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/accessibility-statement), with additional references to DEFRA's [data services platform](https://environment.data.gov.uk/support/faqs/275810340/694845441). 

This website is run by UKCEH for DEFRA's internal use. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to: 

-   Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings 

-   Zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen 

-   Navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software 

-   Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) 

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
